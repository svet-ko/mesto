# Project Mesto

### Review

Project - an application profile page created to work out modern adaptive layout (using grids, flexboxes, forms and animations) and Javascript, including interaction with the DOM tree and event handlers. At the moment, the application has the ability to edit user data, add your own photos and descriptions to them, as well as put likes.
